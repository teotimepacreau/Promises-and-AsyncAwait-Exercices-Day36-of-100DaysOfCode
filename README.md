# Learned
- Promises are useful when performing a single asynchronous task
- Promises are based on `resolve and reject`, if it `resolves` the `.then` executes, if it `rejects` we `.catch` the error
- Some APIs already have in-built promises as the the fetch API allowing to directly use `.then` and `.catch`
- `Async/Await` : `async` make the function a promise, two blocks similar as `resolve` and `reject` : `try` and `catch`, we put the `await` in the `try` block, `await` allows to wait for the execution of a function before performing a task
